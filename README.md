I have developed a recipe book web application using React.js. The recipe book allow users to view recipes. Some of the feaures of recipe book are :
- User Authentication: Users are able to sign up, login, and logout
- Recipe Catalog: A list of recipes with their details (name, ingredients, instructions, and image)
- Recipe Details: Users are able to view the details of a recipe, including its ingredients,instructions, and image
- User Profile: Users are able to view their profile, which should include their saved recipes
- Use of Axios for API calls
- Proper use of React components, hooks, and routing
- Proper use of Bootstrap and materual-UI library
- Proper use of form validation and error handling
